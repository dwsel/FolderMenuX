# 🗂️ FolderMenuX — Bring Back the Windows 10 Taskbar Folder Menu (for Windows 11)

**FolderMenuX** is a lightweight, zero-UI utility that replicates the classic **Taskbar Folder Toolbar** from Windows 10 — now missing in Windows 11.

No bloated launchers. No shell hacks. Just a simple context menu at your cursor that lets you navigate any folder tree and open files directly with their default apps — complete with native Windows icons.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 **Browse any folder** (and its subfolders) as a cascading menu
- 🔹 **Launch files** with their associated applications
- 🔹 **Lazy-loading submenus** for fast startup
- 🔹 **Native file & folder icons** via Windows Shell API
- 🔹 **Zero interface** — no window, no tray icon, no distractions
- 🔹 **Auto-exits** when the menu is closed

## 💡 Why?

Microsoft removed the **Taskbar > Toolbar > Folder** feature in Windows 11, leaving power users with no native replacement.

FolderMenuX brings it back — as a modern, minimalist popup menu. Ideal for:

- Developers with complex project directories
- Anyone who wants quick access to structured content without clutter
